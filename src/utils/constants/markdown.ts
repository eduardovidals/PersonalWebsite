# Building a Sorting Visualizer
![Sorting Visualizer Website](${sortingVisualizer})

Thanks for exploring my page a bit more! This project was largely inspired by Clément Mihailescu's sorting visualizer. 

The sorting visualizer was the beginning of a bigger project known as AlgoVisual, which aims to visualize common
sorting and pathfinding algorithms. 

The reason for starting the project was that I was always amazed by the beauty of algorithms and thought the best way
to deeply understand the algorithms was to create a website that visualizes them!

Now, at this time, I had finished a popular Coursera course offered by Princeton University, which is known as 
Algorithms Part I & II by Robert Sedgewich & Kevin Wayne, which can be found 
[here.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)

The course was an amazing course that offered me ability to learn algorithms and data structures at a deeper level,
which would have not been possible to learn within my university's curriculum.

Despite that, I chose to learn web technologies such as HTML & CSS from freeCodeCamp and further enhanced my skills 
by learning a library such as React.

After extensive learning, I was able to implement a sorting visualizer that implemented algorithms such as:
Merge Sort, Quick Sort, & Heap Sort.

The code for the sorting visualizer can be found
